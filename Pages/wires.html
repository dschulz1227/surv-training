            <div class="tertiaryTitle">What is Coax Cable?</div>
            Coaxial cable is a type of cable that has an inner conductor surrounded by an insulating layer,
            surrounded by a conductive shielding. Many also have an insulating outer jacket The diagram below
            illustrates the construction of a typical cable. Electrical signal flows through the center conductor. </br>

            <div class="tertiaryTitle">Where will we see coax cable?</div>
            Coax cable is a technology that is being phased out but there are many instances where we will come
            across or use it,
            obviously the first being inside the server room connecting the receiver to the encoders. The coax cable
            used to run directly from a receiver to the DVR or monitor. There are also some areas
            where we have not yet replaced the coax cable. The most common area youll find coax cable still running
            to a camera is in the North Hotel.Category Cable is ran from our server room (wall) to the casino
            ceiling.
            From there , a balun is used to connect the cat cable to a coax cable that runs through the walls up to
            the camera. When troubleshooting cameras in the north hotel this is very important to remember.

        <div style="padding-bottom: 3em;">
            Category Cable (Cat) comes in different types and sizes. What we use now mainly is Cat5e cable. but there
            are some areas where you will come across cat 3 but usually we will run cat5e wire in their place.
            Cat3 Cable only has a data rate of 10 mbps, it is inefficient on modern networks.
            cat5 cable has a data rate up to 100 mbps and candistribute data, video and telephone signals at distances
            Cat5e cable has a data rate up to 1gbps.

                At the end of Category cables you will find (mostly) RJ45's. The 8 position 8 contact twisted
                pair jack is the most common and standardized way to connect
                telecommunincation and data equipment.
                These will be used when connecting any equipment of ours to our IP network. Our Avigilon digital IP
                cameras and patch cables are where you will use this most.

                -Color patterns
                rj45s have specific patterns of wiring called pinouts. such as T-568A and T-568B, and the crossover
                pinout.
                The standard we use is T-568B. Each end of the cable must have a matching pinout to ensure proper
                distribution of data. If they are not the same, the cable will not work

                The process for terminating a Cat cable is simple and tedious, but can often be done wrong. First you
                must strip the shielding of the cable to expose the 4 pairs of wire.
                untwist each pair and straighten them to the best of your ability.
                manipulate the wire to be in the pattern of your choice (t568b) and ensure they are flat and.
                you will slide the rj45 over the wires while the pins of the jack are facing you.
                Ensure the pattern is correct within the jack and use the crimper to secure the termination.
                once each side is terminated you can test it with the LinkMaster Wiremapper and Tester</br>

            Testing a Cat cable is done using a tool we have called "LinkMaster Wiremapper and Tester"
            Each end of the cable is plugged into either of the boxes of the wiremapper. It's usually most convenient to
            connect the first
            end to the box without a button, and take the controller (button) with you to the location of the opposite
            end of the cable.
            Once it's plugged in and the button is pressed a signal is sent to the other end and back again. This will
            tell you if the cable
            is properly terminated.

                A Toner and Probe is used to trace pairs of wire within a Cat cable.
                Simply, each clamp is clipped to either of the wires in a pair.
                Then to turn on the Toner you press the button on the left with the words "Off, Solid, Alt"
                These indicate the three settings of a toner.
                Off obviously means that the toner is not powered on.
                Solid means that the toner will send an electric signal through the line which is audible
                when the probe is near it, in a constant tone.
                Alt means the toner will sound off in different patterns of tones, making it easier to trace and
                identify
                different pairs of wires.
