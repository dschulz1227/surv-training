                half(pants).
                After that, you have to select a timeframe for which you are searching for the object of interest.
                The last image shows that you must select which cameras you want to use for the search. It is displayed
                in the same format as the site tree, making it simple to find which cameras you are looking for.
                It is preset on all cameras that have analytic capabbilities.

                shared anywhere, and the file is
                exported with a version of Aviglon Player, giving others the capability to view the exported footage.
