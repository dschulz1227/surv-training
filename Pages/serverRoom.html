            Middle Aisle
            left-side:on the left side, it is obvious we are looking at the back of the receivers. You'll notice BNC
            ports with coax cable shooting over to the encoders, that is the path for the image to the network
            It is quite unorganized so while working in this area it is imperative to pay close attention to what
            you are doing. it is very easy to mistakenly unplug or disconnect something. When running a new analog
            image to an
            encoder you first must find an empty spot on a receiver. Some ports may have wires going into them but
            nothing plugged into the BNC port. This is an empty channel and can be used by replacing the two wires
            with
            the ones from your camera, then over to an encoder.

            right-side: On the right side you'll notice it is also an unorganized mess. There you will mostly find
            coax cables running into the encoders. You'll also see short, yellow cables that are called patch cables
            which
            are used to connect the encoder to the switch. On the back of the encoders are also audio ports. not
            many are being used but the ones that are always need to be properly connected. they are crucial to the
            operation
            of security and surveillance within the casino.

                the cables
                running to and from the receivers. The large white cable holds about 32 pairs of UTP wiring, shortening
                the number of
                cables needed to be ran.

                Here we are looking at the far end of the right side of the middle row of racks. You can see all the

                cables running into
                their respective encoders where the analog images will be converted into data and sent over the network
                to
                the server. May be hard to see,
                but the encoders have 4 ports and 4 lights to go with them. If there is a cable running into the encoder
                but
                no light is on, that means There
                is an issue with the circuit for that camera. Whether it be at the camera, a splice, a punch block,

                The right aisle is the front of the encoders. Along with them, are switches and servers. You'll notice

                address that
                have been assigned to it. These are specific to which switch they are connected two with the patch
                cables. Each encoder has it's own IP Address that has 4 channels on it, the encoder.

                You can also see in the middle an old patch panel no longer in use and above that is the system
