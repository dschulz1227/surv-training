                response times by quickly identifying people of interest. Facial recognition offers the context to make
                better informed decisions that empower you to respond to events proactively.div></br></br>
                Customers using our AI-powered technologies can have a significant impact on society. That’s why we take
                a more rigorous approach to the application of AI that extends beyond the fundamental tenets of
                fairness, privacy, understandability and reliability. The use of facial recognition in our technology is
                ‘assistive’ in that we only use it to assist humans in performing tasks they are already authorized and
                allowed to do. When applied correctly, AI is an incredibly powerful tool that can be used to increase
                the effectiveness of physical security systems, deliver on business outcomes and improve safety.</br>

                People of interest are identified based on one or more secure watch lists managed by authorized users at
                your organization. Users can populate and manage multiple watch lists by either adding faces
                from Appearance Search, uploading reference images, or finding appearances of the person through
                recorded video. The Identity Retention settings also allow face match events and Appearance Search
                metadata to be aged out ahead of video if desired.</br>

                <h6 style="padding-top:2em">Robust Controls</h6>
                Robust controls within Avigilon’s facial recognition technology governs the accessibility and retention
                of watch list data. Authorized users are able to add, edit, and manipulate watch lists, while also
                adjusting the retention periods of watch list profiles</br>

                Augment watch list(s) with alarms that provide operators greater context for people of interest entering
                a site. If a watch list match is found, operators can be notified either using the Focus of Attention
                interface or through ACC™ alarms using armed panels or the alarm view. ACC will display the video image
                that triggered the alarm and the reference image from the watch list, enabling operators to verify the
                match and act quickly.

                Avigilon is the first video management software vendor to add native facial recognition technology that
                is easy to deploy, highly scalable and affordable. In the future, Avigilon’s facial recognition

            Avigilon's self-learning analytics extends the effectiveness of your security personnel by providing
            effective monitoring and enabling proactive, real-time response from your team. Built from the ground up to
            manage high-definition video, Avigilon offers analytics embedded in Avigilon cameras up to 5K (16 MP)

            <h6>ADVANCED PATTERN-BASED ANALYTICS</h6>
            Avigilon's advanced video pattern detection technology is able to accurately recognize the movements of
            people and vehicles while ignoring motion not relevant to a scene. Embedded into cameras up to 5K (16 MP),
            the system's ability to constantly learn reduces false positives and helps ensure alerts are meaningful,
            which avoids wasted time and improves efficiencies.

            <h6>TEACH-BY-EXAMPLE TECHNOLOGY</h6>
            Our teach-by-example object classifier technology enables users to provide feedback about the accuracy
            of alarm events generated by Avigilon devices. Rather than decreasing analytics sensitivity to reduce false
            alarms, the feedback trains the device, increasing the accuracy of the analytics used to determine which
            alarms are real and which are false to further improve a low false-positive alarm rate. Over time, the
            system learns the scene and is able to prioritize important events based on user feedback. This increases
            sensitivity to conditions that are of concern while reducing false alarms to keep the focus on what matter

        <div class="subtitle">Focus of Attention</div>
        <div class="row">
            Focus of Attention (FoA) introduces a new concept in video monitoring and brings to the user a more
            intuitive
            way to consume information about potential security events.

            Intuitive Interface
            The FoA interface shows a comprehensive topology of your entire camera population, with nodes that represent
            each camera, grouped in a honeycomb formation according to how cameras are organized in the Site View
            (system
            tree) in Avigilon Control Center (ACC). 

            AI-Powered Notifications
            Powered by Avigilon cameras and appliances with self-learning and next-generation analytics, the FoA
            interface
            uses artificial intelligence to detect and flag events that may require your attention, highlighting them
            visually in color-coded nodes to indicate different levels of importance:
            • Blue: Motion Detected
            • Teal: Unusual Motion Detected or Analytic Event
            • Yellow: Unusual Activity Detected, Face Watch List Match Event, License Plate Watch List Match Event,
            or No
            Face Mask Detected
            • Red: Alarm


            Simple Navigation
            For operators, this provides a clean and simple display to verify security event notifications. With just a
            simple mouse hover over the illuminated node, operators can preview the live video or click into the node to
            expand it for a closer review and replay of the event.

                Both are edge-based, intelligent technologies that distinguish between typical and atypical events
                by
                continuously learning from observation of scenes over time. Where Unusual Activity Detection (UAD)
                is
                object-aware and detects the atypical behavior of learned objects like people and vehicles, Unusual
                Motion
                Detection (UMD) technology continuously learns what a typical scene looks like, then detects and
                flags
                unusual motions that deviate from that model.
