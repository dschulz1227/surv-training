                AI-powered facial recognition technology, within Avigilon Control Center (ACC), helps you accelerate response times by quickly identifying people of interest. Facial recognition offers the context to make better informed decisions that empower you to
                respond to events proactively.div> Customers using our AI-powered technologies can have a significant impact on society. That’s why we take a more rigorous approach to the application of AI that extends beyond the fundamental tenets of
                fairness, privacy, understandability and reliability. The use of facial recognition in our technology is ‘assistive’ in that we only use it to assist humans in performing tasks they are already authorized and allowed to do. When applied
                correctly, AI is an incredibly powerful tool that can be used to increase the effectiveness of physical security systems, deliver on business outcomes and improve safety.

                    finding appearances of the person through recorded video. The Identity Retention settings also allow face match events and Appearance Search metadata to be aged out ahead of video if desired.

            Avigilon's self-learning analytics extends the effectiveness of your security personnel by providing effective monitoring and enabling proactive, real-time response from your team. Built from the ground up to manage high-definition video, Avigilon offers

            Avigilon's advanced video pattern detection technology is able to accurately recognize the movements of people and vehicles while ignoring motion not relevant to a scene. Embedded into cameras up to 5K (16 MP), the system's ability to constantly learn
            reduces false positives and helps ensure alerts are meaningful, which avoids wasted time and improves efficiencies.

            Our teach-by-example object classifier technology enables users to provide feedback about the accuracy of alarm events generated by Avigilon devices. Rather than decreasing analytics sensitivity to reduce false alarms, the feedback trains the device,
            increasing the accuracy of the analytics used to determine which alarms are real and which are false to further improve a low false-positive alarm rate. Over time, the system learns the scene and is able to prioritize important events based
            on user feedback. This increases sensitivity to conditions that are of concern while reducing false alarms to keep the focus on what matter

            Focus of Attention (FoA) introduces a new concept in video monitoring and brings to the user a more intuitive way to consume information about potential security events. Intuitive Interface The FoA interface shows a comprehensive topology of your entire
            camera population, with nodes that represent each camera, grouped in a honeycomb formation according to how cameras are organized in the Site View (system tree) in Avigilon Control Center (ACC).  AI-Powered Notifications Powered by Avigilon
            cameras and appliances with self-learning and next-generation analytics, the FoA interface uses artificial intelligence to detect and flag events that may require your attention, highlighting them visually in color-coded nodes to indicate
            different levels of importance: • Blue: Motion Detected • Teal: Unusual Motion Detected or Analytic Event • Yellow: Unusual Activity Detected, Face Watch List Match Event, License Plate Watch List Match Event, or No Face Mask Detected • Red:
            Alarm Simple Navigation For operators, this provides a clean and simple display to verify security event notifications. With just a simple mouse hover over the illuminated node, operators can preview the live video or click into the node to
            expand it for a closer review and replay of the event.

                Both are edge-based, intelligent technologies that distinguish between typical and atypical events by continuously learning from observation of scenes over time. Where Unusual Activity Detection (UAD) is object-aware and detects the atypical behavior
                of learned objects like people and vehicles, Unusual Motion Detection (UMD) technology continuously learns what a typical scene looks like, then detects and flags unusual motions that deviate from that model.
